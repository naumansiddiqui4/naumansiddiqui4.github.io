\setlist{nolistsep}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0.6cm, label={\textbullet}]
\item Scaled the platform from 4 to 50 institutions, owning backend architecture strategy and enabling reliable performance for 100k+ students.
\item Designed microservice-based components to isolate critical workflows and improve service resiliency during peak evaluation loads—raising student survey completion rates from under 40\% to over 60\%.
\item Built attribute-based analytics capabilities that reduced reliance on external BI tools by 70\%+ and improved institutional reporting depth.
\item Led AI-driven reporting initiatives by integrating LLM-powered qualitative analysis into institutional reports and initiating development of data-accessible chatbots to enable conversational exploration of evaluation insights.
\item As the team’s technical lead, coordinated roadmap priorities with product and mentored engineers, delivering two major releases across consecutive semester cycles with all committed features shipped.

\setlist{nolistsep}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0.6cm, label={\textbullet}]
\item Led EC2-based pilots across 5 institutions, delivering zero-downtime evaluation cycles with reliable reporting—converting 4 into full-time paying customers.
\item Re-architected multi-tenant AWS infrastructure using Terraform to enable secure self-service onboarding—reducing effort by 60\% and meeting HECVAT requirements for broader adoption.
\item Built a fine-grained RBAC/ABAC system enabling feature-level access control for surveys, reporting, and setup—meeting R1 institutional governance needs and surpassing industry-leading platforms.
\item Reduced page-load latency by 45\% by optimizing high-traffic queries, implementing effective caching and eviction policies, and upgrading supporting infrastructure to improve overall system responsiveness.
\item Designed and built the end-to-end “15-minute or less” institutional survey-setup feature—adding auto-syncing, reusable term-over-term settings, and guided workflows that reduced manual setup effort from 1–2 days to under 15 minutes.
\item Added a flexible data-ingestion framework allowing institutions to upload CSVs or fetch API data and map it to our models—supporting diverse data structures and reducing implementation effort by 50\%.
