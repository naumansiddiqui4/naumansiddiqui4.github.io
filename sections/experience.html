    <h3>Selected Initiatives</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Product and engineering roadmap alignment.</strong>
            Partnered with product and implementation teams to establish a structured
            feature planning process, including scope definition, risk assessment,
            and role-based user flows before development begins. This approach
            reduced scope creep, clarified expectations across teams, and enabled
            engineers to execute with higher confidence and autonomy.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Release communication and organizational alignment.</strong>
            Drove a release-updates practice where new features were accompanied by
            concise recorded explanations of scope and behavior, ensuring sales,
            implementation, and engineering teams shared a consistent understanding
            of product changes and delivery intent.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Risk-driven delivery and mitigation.</strong>
            Worked with implementation teams to identify feature risks early,
            classify issue severity, and define mitigation strategies, improving
            release stability and prioritization during high-impact delivery cycles.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>15-minute survey setup workflow.</strong>
            Designed reusable term configurations, validation rules, and safe defaults to reduce administrative setup
            time from hours to minutes while supporting institution-specific requirements.
        </li>
    </ul>
