<h4>ABOUT</h4>
<div class="about-block">
    <p class="section-text">
        I’m a Lead Engineer and founding team member at <a href="https://classranked.com/">Classranked</a>, where I design and build the 
        backend systems that power our multi-tenant SaaS platform. I work across architecture, APIs, 
        data modeling, security, microservices, and cloud infrastructure, and I lead engineering 
        initiatives from planning through execution. Recently, I’ve also focused on bringing AI/LLMs 
        into our reporting tools to help institutions explore their evaluation data more deeply 
        and interactively.

    <p class="section-text">
        Before stepping into a lead role, I helped grow ClassRanked from its early stages—modernizing 
        our backend, building multi-tenant capabilities, developing automated ingestion workflows, 
        improving performance, and creating internal tools that enabled us to scale rapidly across 
        dozens of universities.

        I completed my Master’s in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.odu.edu/">Old Dominion University</a>, where I worked in the 
        <a href="https://ws-dl.cs.odu.edu/">Web Science & Digital Libraries (WS-DL) Lab</a> under <a href="https://www.cs.odu.edu/~mln/">Dr. Michael L. Nelson</a> and 
        <a href="https://www.cs.odu.edu/~mweigle/">Dr. Michele C. Weigle</a>. My research focused on using web archives to recover and 
        analyze deleted tweets from members of the U.S. Congress, combining information 
        retrieval, temporal analysis, and large-scale visualization. This work deepened 
        my interest in systems that organize, preserve, and reason about complex data.

    <p class="section-text">
        Prior to graduate school, I spent 2.5 years at <a href="https://services.harman.com/">Harman Connected Services (India)</a>, developing IoT Gateway 
        components, wearable application integrations, and system-level Android/AOSP 
        features for clients such as Vodafone, Verizon, The Weather Channel, AT&T, and 
        British Telecom.
    </p>
    <p class="section-text">
        I’m passionate about system architecture, distributed services, secure and scalable data systems, 
        and applying AI to real-world workflows.
