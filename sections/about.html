<h2>About</h2>
<div class="about-block">
    <p class="section-text">
        Building reliable insight from large-scale academic feedback is a
        deceptively hard problem—one that sits at the intersection of data,
        systems, and institutional trust. At <a href="https://classranked.com/">Classranked</a>, I work on
        turning high-volume course evaluation data into a dependable, scalable
        service institutions can rely on. I joined early and have grown alongside the
        platform, helping shape it from an initial idea into a production system
        now used by 50+ institutions and 200,000+ users, including <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/resources/institution_classifications/r1">R1 universities</a>.
        A core focus has been reducing operational friction—making evaluations
        configurable in 15 minutes or less while preserving flexibility, performance,
        and meaningful analysis at scale.

    <p class="section-text">
        My approach to this work is grounded in experience working with data at
        scale and performing analysis on complex, real-world datasets. During my
        Master’s in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.odu.edu/">Old Dominion University</a>, I conducted research in the
        <a href="https://ws-dl.cs.odu.edu/">Web Science & Digital Libraries Lab</a> under
        <a href="https://www.cs.odu.edu/~mln/">Dr. Michael L. Nelson</a> and
        <a href="https://www.cs.odu.edu/~mweigle/">Dr. Michele C. Weigle</a>, where I worked on collecting,
        analyzing, and visualizing large-scale web and social media datasets.
        That experience shaped how I reason about data pipelines, performance,
        and system behavior under scale. Alongside this foundation, graduate study
        in Project Management informs how I plan, coordinate, and deliver systems
        that balance technical depth with execution.

<h3>Interests</h3>
<div class="about-block">
    <p class="section-text">
        I focus on building scalable, multi-tenant systems that support complex workflows,
        high-volume data, and policy- and context-aware authorization using both role- and
        attribute-based access control. My work centers on reliable analytics, secure data
        boundaries, and applying AI to deliver trustworthy insights in production environments.
